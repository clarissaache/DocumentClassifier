# DocumentClassifier

The models in this directory are compared. They exist in two Jupyter notebooks: lda.ipynb for the LDA probabilistic approach, and lstmClassifier.ipynb for the neural network model.

The original Web of Science data is in data/WebOfScienceData.xlsx, and the synthetic data is stored in mockdata.csv. The required packages to run the two files that contain the comapred models are listed in requirements.txt.
