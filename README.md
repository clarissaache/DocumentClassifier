# DocumentClassifier

The models compared in these project are in two Jupyter notebooks: lda.ipynb for the LDA probabilistic approach and lstmClassifier.ipynb for the neural network model. The real Web os Science data is in WebOfScienceData.xlsx, and the synthetic data is stored in mockdata.csv. The required packages to run the two files that contain the comapred models are listed in requirements.txt.
